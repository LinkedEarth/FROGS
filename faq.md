# FAQ

### Q: Who is this hackathon for?

A: This hackathon is open to all geoscientists already engaged in research eager to learn more about science publishing to advance their knowledge about FAIR science publishing. 

### Q: What is the format?

A: The workshop is virtual and will run for 4 days (February 11-14 2025), during which we will alternate between lectures, directed homework and personal study/research time.  Collaboration will be encouraged at every level, and we will select attendees with a mix of interests/expertise to maximize intellectual cross-pollination. Participants will present on their research progress on the last day. The workshop will continue for 6-8 weeks after the synchronous event to allow for more in-depth studying of the materials. Office hours will be made available throughout this period. Completion of the workshop will be assessed by the submission of GitHub repository that follows FAIR publishing principles with a workflow executable through myBinder.. 

### Q: Do I need to know Python/R to attend this hackathon?

A: Yes. We will not assist you with code development during this workshop. All your analyses should have be run prior to the event. 

### Q: What do I need to bring?

A: Data, software and workflow. We cannot beam coffee over to you unfortunately but we will organize informal coffee break during the day so we get to know each other. 


### Q: What are the technical requirements?

A: You will need access to Zoom and Slack. A GitHub account and a repository are also needed for completion of the workshop.

### Q: How do I register for the workshop?

A: Please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/SbbVykECg3ZhW4hh7) by **January 10th 2025**.

### Q: Will I be working alone?

A: No, this a team-building exercise

### Q: What will I get out of this?

A: The goal is to bring your research to the next level, by learning publishing techniques that are required by more and more journals and funding agencies. You will also meet fellow researchers at various career stages, hopefully making lifelong friendships and building your professional network. 

### Q: I am in a Master program and I am not planning to apply to a PhD, is this for me?

A: Yes! You will be able to reuse what your learn in this workshop outside an academic career.

### Q: I see that you had the first training session in 2024. Should have I attended the first training workshop to be eligible for FAIRLeap?

A: No. Attendance to the PyRATES workshop is not necessary for FAIRLeap. 

### Q: I would love to attend but have previous committments. Is there a way for me to participate? 

A: The lectures will be released asynchronously and you can also use our [platform](http://linked.earth/LeapFROGS/) to learn more about science publishing 

### Q: OK, I'm sold. What happens next?

A: Once you have registered, the organizers will review applications and expect to make decisions by mid-January. If you are selected, you will be asked to accept our Slack invitation. 

This is to make sure you can hit the ground running on February 11th.

### Q: My application was not accepted. What did I do wrong?
A: You did nothing wrong! There are many possible reasons, but in the past the lead causes of rejection have been:
- __rationale for attending is not sufficiently articulated__: You need to explain why it will advance your scientific career to do this. Vague responses to the questionnaires will be dismissed. Response such as "I want to learn Python" also often lead to a rejection. This is not a Python short course. You need to demonstrate an enthusiasm for learning FAIR scientific publishing practices. 
- __too many people from the same research group__. While we are honored that some PIs are encouraging their entire labs to apply, we strive to balance opportunities between universities. Since this event is virtual, we expect to accomodate up to 100 applicants.
