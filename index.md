title: pyRATES: Python and R Analysis of Time SerieS

---

## June 3-6, 2024, Marina Del Rey, CA
The geosciences are entering an exciting phase, with open-source research ecosystems opening new avenues of investigation. With this great power comes great responsibility: sharing research data, software, and worflow is fundamental to building a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) open science ecocystem. [FROGS](http://linked.earth/FROGS/about) is a new initiative from [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth) that links together science practice and publishing in a series of synchronous and asynchronous trainings. 

The first training opportunity will kick off **June 3-6 2024 in [Marina Del Rey,CA](https://linkedearth.github.io/FROGS/marina)** and will consist of foundational training in Python and R for the geosciences, with an emphasis on time series analysis. 

* *Intended audience:* researchers with no to little experience in Python, R, and their associated science and publishing ecosystems. 
* *Learning objectives:* basics of scientific Python and/or R; use of open source geoscience software in research; statistical concepts in time series analysis; FAIR science publishing; optional: paleoclimate data acumen. 
* *Description:* The workshop will consist of a blend of lectures and directed homework in the morning. Afternoon sessions will be reserved for participant's own research needs. 
* *Completion:* Submission of a notebook (or R markdown) reproducing a study (or part thereof) in their field, published according to FAIR principles. 

## Format
This training will be both synchronous (with the kickoff event in Marina del Rey) and asynchronous over the next 8-10 weeks. The synchronous event will consist of a mixture of lectures, directed homeworks and dedicated time for research or more in-depth tutorials. The asynchronous portion will consist of the development of a Jupyter Notebook reproducing a study (or part thereof) in their field, published according to FAIR principles. The asynchronous portion will be supported through virtual office hours over the 6 weeks following the synchronous event. Final notebooks should be submitted 2 weeks after the end of the asynchronous period. Both the synchronous and asynchronous events will be supported by an online platform, LeapFROGS (a prototype version is available [here](http://linked.earth/ec_workshops_py/)) to learn or review relevant material.
